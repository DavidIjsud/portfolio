        I'm David, a dedicated Mobile Engineer with over 7 years of experience building high-quality Android and Flutter applications. I specialize in delivering scalable and user-focused solutions, from fintech platforms to e-commerce and logistics apps, with a strong track record at companies like Presto, Loyalty Clubs, and Manzana Verde Inc.
        <br />
        <br />
        My core stack includes Kotlin, Flutter, Firebase, CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Codemagic and NestJS with TypeScript for backend. I have hands-on experience with secure mobile development practices, modern architecture patterns like MVVM and Clean Architecture, and backend development using NestJS to create robust RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iâ€™m skilled across the full stack, particularly in Flutter, Firebase, and clean architecture, and I pride myself on efficient workflows with
        CI/CD integration using GitHub and Codemagic. No matter the project, I aim to build resilient, scalable code that keeps users coming back.
        <br/>
        Whether working in startups or enterprise environments, I take full ownership of product development, from planning and implementation to release. I'm passionate about crafting smooth, reliable user experiences and contributing to high-impact mobile products.
